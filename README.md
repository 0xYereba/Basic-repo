# First Readme File
Here is the first well-formatted README file on this GitHub account
and it's quite interesting, isn't it?

### Your Next task:
> *Create a directory and write your goals for the next 3 weeks,
in a file inside the directory. Ensure you have a README there as well*

Reachout to Topman as soon as you're done.
