# First Readme File
Here is the first well-formatted README file on this GitHub account
and it's quite interesting, isn't it?

### Previous task:
> *Create a directory and write your goals for the next 3 weeks,
in a file inside the directory. Ensure you have a README there as well*

### Next task:
> *Create a new branch named `branch2`. add in it a directory named
**c_programs**, create a file in this directory with the name `hello.c`
and write in it a `c` program that prints **Hello CodeTrybe!***
