You did not follow the instructions, **repeat**.
Every good student of ALX knows how to pay attention to
the smallest detail in a task.

-----

###### NOW LET'S GO OVER THIS AGAIN
The instruction was:
> Create a directory and write your goals for the next 3 weeks, in a file inside the directory. Ensure you have a README there as well
Let us break it into bits:
- Create a directory

*You actually did this*
- Write your goals for the next 3 weeks, in a file inside the directory.

*This was where you missed it, pay attention to the next instruction*
- Ensure you have a README there as well

*This means that the README file is different from the
main task that you were given.

Note that:
- You were not told what to write in the README file,
so you're free to write anything but not the main task
- You were not given the name of the directory or file,
so, you're free to give them any names, but I that use
`.txt`, rather than `.md` *(except for the README)*
